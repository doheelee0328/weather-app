# React Weather App 

The React Weather App is a web application that provides weather details based on the city and country entered by the user. The app dynamically adjusts its background images to reflect the current weather condition.

## To run the React Weather App, you can follow these steps:

- Open a terminal or command prompt.

- Navigate to the project directory using the cd command. For example, if your project is located in a folder called "weather-app", you would run:

"cd weather-app"

- Run the following command to install all the project dependencies listed in the package.json file:

"npm install"

- Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

"npm start"

The app will now be running locally on your machine. You can open a web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app.


## Design 

For the React Weather App, the Figma tool was used to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design. The design incorporates different background images that represent the current weather condition.

Background Images:

- Sunny
- Cloudy
- Rain
- Snow
- Storm

## Usage

- You will see a user interface where you can enter the city and country for which you want to check the weather.

- In the input field provided, enter the name of the city and the country (optional but recommended for accurate results). For example, you can enter "New York" or "London, UK".

- Hit Enter on your keyboard to submit the input.

- The app will then fetch the weather data for the specified location from the weather API.

- After a brief loading period, the app will display the weather details on the screen. This may include information such as temperature. 

- Observe the background image of the app, which dynamically changes based on the current weather condition
