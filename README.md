# React Weather App 

The React Weather App is a web application that provides weather details based on the city and country entered by the user. The app dynamically adjusts its background images to reflect the current weather condition.

## To run the React Weather App, you can follow these steps:

### Note!  To use this weather app, you will need to obtain an API key. The API key allows the app to fetch real-time weather data.

- Open a terminal or command prompt.

- Navigate to the project directory using the cd command. For example, if your project is located in a folder called "weather-app", you would run "cd weather-app"

- Run the following command to install all the project dependencies listed in the package.json file with "npm install"

- Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command "npm start"

- The app will now be running locally on your machine. You can open a web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## Design 

For the React Weather App, the Figma tool was used to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design. The design incorporates different background images that represent the current weather condition.

Background Images:

- Sunny
- Cloudy
- Rain
- Snow
- Storm
